# RGB-Colour-Conversion
Converts RGB values that are in the 0 - 1 scale to the 0 - 255 scale and hex. Specifically made to run through Cobalt's colors.lua file. Both files run on Python 3.6.

The default ColourConversion.py is made to create lists off one name (e.g. You enter "metal" and each line is prepended by "metal1", "metal2", so on and so forth. (useful for values like metal or bone which are a collection of possible colours for that value)) ColourConversionPerCase allows you to enter each name per line (useful for values earlier in the file).


### Â¡Important!

ColourConversion and ColourConversionPerCase: When you are finished with your work, enter a number greater than 1 for the R value. I tend to enter "9". This will close the file it created and exit the program. I made this as a personal tool, but you are welcome to use it as well.

ColourConversion255: When you are finished with your work, enter a number greater than 255 for the R value.

ColourConversionAllInclusive: When you are finished with your work, enter a number greater than 1 when you are prompted for the type of input.
